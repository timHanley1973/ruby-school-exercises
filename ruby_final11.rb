# Exercise 11, Ruby final exercises #

# I prefer ruby-doc, mostly because of Launch School's recommendation. I
# want to be on the same page with the institution which is 
# about to teach me a new and valuable skill. Also, it's very straight 
# forward and user-friendly. It encourages a user to learn more. #
